      <Description>
        The Tosa (土佐, also called the Tosa Inu, Tosa-Ken or Japanese Mastiff)
        is a breed of dog of Japanese origin that is considered rare. It was
        originally bred in Tosa, Shikoku (present day Kōchi) as a fighting dog
        and is the only breed still used (legally) in Japanese dog fighting.[1]
        Ownership is restricted in some countries as a dangerous breed.
